Introduction
============

During my ([@fd0](https://github.com/fd0)) research before starting
[restic](https://restic.github.io) I've tested a lot of different backup
programs. However, even after working in this space for a few years, I still
stumble across backup solutions I didn't know about.

In this repository, I'd like to collect backup solutions and eventually end up
with an exhaustive list of backup software. The criteria for inclusion are:

 * Free Software (not just Open Source)
 * Does not require custom network/cloud service to operate (sorry,
   [tarsnap](http://www.tarsnap.com/))
 * Works on Linux

If you know other backup solutions that fit the criteria above, please create a
pull request!
